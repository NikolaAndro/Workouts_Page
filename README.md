# Mealplan Builder page

On this page the idea is as follows:

1. Select the meal plan based on the number of calories given that meal plans are provided and located in a certain directory
2. If there is no satisfying meal plan, then enter your username and password of nutritionvalue.org website and select the date where you created the desired mealplan
3. JavaScript will scrape the necessary data and save into variables
4. You have the ability to select the number of days you'd like to eat each meal plan
5. Based on number of days, it will generate the grocery list
6. The list will be having check marks so you can check them as you shop
7. You will be able to send that grocery list to your email

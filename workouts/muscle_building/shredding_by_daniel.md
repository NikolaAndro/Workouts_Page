description: This is a very intense workout for muscle building. There are going to be many supersets without rest. This a technique that body builders use to avoid cardio and still burn the same amount of calories. There are 6 workouts per week. About 1.5 h per workout on average. <b>THERE IS NO REST BETWEEN THE SETS!!!</b><br><br>Note that every week you will workout the following groups of muscles in the following manner  <br><br> Monday ~ Back & Biceps <br> Tuesday ~ Legs & Shoulders <br> Wednesday ~ Chest & Triceps <br> Thursday ~ Back & Biceps <br> Friday ~ Legs & Shoulders <br> Saturday ~ Chest & Triceps <br> Sunday ~ rest <br><br> Also note that every week you workout each muscle group twice! The second time in the week you want to go a bit lower weight than you would go the first time in the week because you have more energy after your Sunday rest day. <br><br> The most important part of shredding is your diet. Figure it out... I repeated this 4 times in a row = 3 months. <br><br> If you want Daniel as your personal trainer, feel free to contact him on the phone number bellow.

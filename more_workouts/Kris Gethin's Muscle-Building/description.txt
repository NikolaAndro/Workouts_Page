Your mission is to annihilate the old you and stimulate all the mechanisms that will grow the new you. Type 1, type 2a, type 2b—no muscle fiber will be spared. Day by grueling day, you'll exhaust each of your body's energy systems, leaving you with the only energy source that truly matters: your will. What you know about concepts like training intensity and volume will be challenged, cast aside, and redefined.

What is the training style in this program?

Kris Gethin built the Muscle-Building Trainer over the course of 15 years of working with some of the world's best experts and athletes like Neil Hill, Dorian Yates, Branch Warren, Hany Rambod, James "Flex" Lewis, and Jay Cutler. The training strategies and workouts within have been tested and perfected on Kris' many clients around the world and on his own physique.

You'll get a workout on each and every training day page, so you'll encounter most of the specifics as you go through the program. However, over the next 12 weeks, your training program will be broken down into these broad strategies:

Weeks 1-3, Y3T: Y3T is the brainchild of Neil "Yoda" Hill, creator of the immensely popular Y3T 9-Week Trainer. For the first week, you'll work in a relatively low rep range of around 8 repetitions. For the second week, you'll step up to around 12 repetitions. Week 3, however, is the legendary "annihilation week," where you'll use dropsets and other set-extending techniques to push the volume even higher.

Week 4, FST-7: FST, which stands for "fascia stretch training," is a revered training system created by Kris' good friend Hany "The Pro Creator" Rambod, who makes an appearance in the daily videos at the end of Week 3. In this training method, you will stretch the fascia—the sheath around your muscle fibers—while contracting the target muscle between every set.

Week 5, German Volume Training: Variations of what has become known as "German volume training" have been around for decades. What each variation shares is utterly punishing amounts of volume. The magic number is 100 reps, or 10 sets of 10 reps on each muscle group. Keep a partner on hand to count your sets and reps for you so you don't lose track of where you are.

Week 6, High-Intensity Training: Six-time Mr. Olympia Dorian Yates is the mastermind behind high-intensity training, which is also the centerpiece of the 6-week Blood and Guts program. After the high-volume onslaught of GVT, it might be difficult to wrap your mind around the idea of performing only one no-holds-barred working set for each movement. But that set will teach you a lot about how far you've come in the previous six weeks.

Weeks 7-12, DTP: For the last six weeks of this program, you'll be following the principles of DTP and DTPXtreme, which are the culmination of Kris's work in the Hardcore Trainer and DTP: 4 Weeks to Maximum Muscle. You'll encounter a lot of volume alongside extremely heavy weights, a brutal combination that will put your body in a perfect anabolic state. You'll also have to face rest periods tied to the number of reps you perform. So, if you were to knock out 50 reps, you'd only get 50 seconds of rest. Expect to be sore, expect to be tired, and expect to push your limits.

How should I warm up for my workouts?

Kris will often show how he likes to warm up for specific workouts and lifts in his daily videos. Otherwise, if a specific warm-up isn't stated, you can simply spend 5-10 minutes increasing your core body temperature by walking on a treadmill, jogging in place, performing calisthenics such as jumping jacks or toe touches, or mimicking the exercises you plan to perform using little to no weight. Warm-up sets of the first movement are also a great idea. Just remember, warm-up sets should not normally be counted as part of the prescribed sets and reps for the workout, which are often referred to as "working sets."

How heavy should I lift?

The amount of weight you lift for any exercise will always vary based on your current strength and fitness level, as well as the sets and reps of the workout. Unless otherwise specified, the best way to select a weight for any workout is to look at the recommended reps and try to pick a weight that is close to a "rep max" for that rep range.

For example, if you are asked to perform 12-15 reps in a set, select a weight that you believe you can only lift 12 times before reaching muscle failure. If you can lift the weight more than 15 times, add more weight in the next set or workout. If you can't reach 12, the weight is too heavy, so lighten up. It takes experience to find this sweet spot, and it can change over time, so don't worry if it takes a workout or two to find it in this or any other program.

What intensity techniques do I need to know?

Dropset: Take a set to failure, then drop the weight by 20 percent or more and go to failure again.
FST-7 set: Perform 7 sets of 8-10 reps, resting only 30 seconds between. Flex the target muscle during the rest periods.
Superset: Perform two exercises back to back with little to no rest between. A triset is three movements performed in this style. A giant set is four or more.
DTP Set: Perform high-rep sets in descending order, typically 50/40/30/20/10, adding weight with each set and resting around 1 min. between sets. Often, you’ll have to go back up the ladder again, stripping weight and doing 5 sets of 10/20/30/40/50 reps.
DTP Extreme Set: This is like the second half of a DTP set, but with rest periods matching the number of reps you just performed. So 5 seconds after a 5-rep set, 10 sec. after 10 reps, 20 after 20, and so on.
DTP Superset: Perform two paired exercises, alternating sets in a high-rep DTP-style format. Don't rest between the exercise, and rest 1-2 min. between sets. 
DTP Dropset: This is like a DTP extreme set, but with no rest at all! You simply hit your reps, for example 5/10/20/30/40/50, stripping off weight after each set like a continuous dropset.
DTP Giant Set: Perform three or more exercises, alternating sets in a high-rep DTP-style format.
What about cardio?

On workout days, you'll find specific recommendations for cardio at the end of your weights workouts. Kris also recommends staying active on non-lifting days, and will provide recommendations during those videos.

What do I do on rest days?

Definitely stay active! Kris is interested in creating healthy lifters, not just ones seeking size at all costs. But your rest days don't need to involve a treadmill or a gym. These are great days to get out in the world. Hike, swim, explore, play, and restore yourself before you head back into the gym to tear yourself down on Monday.

How do I deal with muscle soreness?

If you haven't been training this intensely consistently before this program, you'll probably be feeling some serious muscle soreness by the time you hit your first rest day. Don't worry: Muscle fiber damage is an essential part of muscle hypertrophy, even if it's not fun.

For your muscles to adapt and get bigger, they need to undergo stress. Soreness is a result of that stress. With proper rest and nutrition, the soreness will pass and you'll get bigger and become stronger. So be patient! That said, you'll still want to do some light movement on your rest days to help your muscles recover.
